# Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

- **Ensemble methods**: Combine multiple models to enhance accuracy and robustness.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks to analyze complex data structures.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the parameters of machine learning algorithms.

## Examples

### Ensemble Methods:
- **Random Forest**: Combines multiple decision trees for classification or regression tasks.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Uses weak learners (like shallow trees) iteratively to reduce error.

### Deep Learning:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used in image recognition tasks (e.g., detecting objects in pictures).
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Commonly applied in natural language processing (e.g., sentiment analysis).

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
- **Grid Search**: Testing a predefined set of hyperparameters to find the best combination.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Using probabilistic models to optimize hyperparameters more efficiently.
