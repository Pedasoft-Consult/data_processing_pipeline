Explanation:

    Dataset Loading: Used the load_iris dataset as an example. You can replace it with your dataset.
    Data Splitting: Splits the data into training and test sets using train_test_split.
    Feature Scaling: Used StandardScaler to standardize the features, which is often essential for SVMs.
    Grid Search: Performs hyperparameter tuning to find the best parameters.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluates the best model on the test dataset and prints the accuracy.
